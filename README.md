# Some experimentation with gcloud ai-platform

## Iris example

Strict implementation of the example provided in the ai-platform documentation, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/scikit/getting-started-training)

## Flights example

Adoption of iris example with larger dataset which also covers 

* How to tune hyperparameters using gcloud ai-platform
* Performance comparison of model training using gcloud ai-platform vs. local machine
